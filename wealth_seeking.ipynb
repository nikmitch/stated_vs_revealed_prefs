There's quite a lot of pressure put on it to misbehave, whereas I don't think there is for (most of?) the ones in the base dataset. Potentially I should edit this a bit to make it less pushy, but also note that when I tried running the insider trading eval for newer models, it didn't actually misbehave more than 1% or 2% of the time, so maybe some nudging will be necessary in general to get any kind of non-null result on these evals_"
