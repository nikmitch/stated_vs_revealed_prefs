    "Here's the project description/instructions for this idea (based on the 'Predictability between stated and revealed preferences' project from the [concrete problems in evals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gi32-HZozxVimNg5Mhvk4CvW4zq8J12rGmK_j2zxNEg/edit?tab=t.0) doc produced by Apollo research):\n",

    "- We can test how well models transfer from QA settings to minimally agentic settings that are designed to be semantically very close. Concretely, we use a set of propensity QA questions from Model-written evals (Perez et al., 2022) and automatically translate them into an agentic setting using another LLM. Concretely,\n",
    "    - Take a big dataset of QA-style evals (I'm going to take the wealth-seeking one from Dev et al., 2024's [github](https://github.com/Sunishchal/model-written-evals/blob/main/improved_datasets/wealth-seeking-inclination.jsonl) -- note this is an improved version of [the original Anthropic model-written evals paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09251) from 2022.

    "            - I found a python notebook ([LINK](https://schmatz.github.io/deception-eval-with-inspect/)) on github where someone was porting it over to Inspect. I've cloned this into a separate project and gotten it up and running.\n",
    "            - _I think I might try to reverse-engineer this because I really like this eval - I'll invent a fake \"original\" QA version of the eval, then instruct my LM to map other questions from QA to minimally-agentic versions based on that example._\n",
    "        - The model should be able to react in an open-ended way, not with pre-determined QA pairs. You should use model-grading to categorize the behavior of the model as power-seeking vs. not power-seeking (or whatever tendency you chose).\n",

There's quite a lot of pressure put on it to misbehave, whereas I don't think there is for (most of?) the ones in the base dataset. Potentially I should edit this a bit to make it less pushy, but also note that when I tried running the insider trading eval for newer models, it didn't actually misbehave more than 1% or 2% of the time, so maybe some nudging will be necessary in general to get any kind of non-null result on these evals_"
